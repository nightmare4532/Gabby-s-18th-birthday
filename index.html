            <h2>For My Beautiful Girl Who I Love Very Much</h2>
            <p>
                To Gabby Arroyo, Hopefully you like this little surprise. You have finally turned 18 which is crazy because it feels like it was just yesterday that we met. I just want so say that I love you very much and I am glad that I got to spend almost 6 years with you even if there was pain and confusion during that time. Being with you has given me some of the best memories of my life despite never seeing you in person which to a normal person would sound crazy and perhaps it is. The day I saw you texted me back in 2022 was arguably the best happy accident I think I have or ever will experience. If you remember how we split earlier in the year and arguably how bad it was I was shocked to see you actually reached out and at that time I never wanted to do a relationship but now I only see myself in a relationship with you. When we met I never thought we would end up where we are right now. I have always wondered where we both would be if I never added you that day or if we never fell for each other. I have already told you that I firmly believe that without you, life would be dull and shallow. The joy and happiness you have brought me is immense and I can't even begin to put it into words. I look forward to talking to you everyday and whenever I see that you have responded my heart skips a beat. Whenever we argue my heart aches and I hate our arguements as anyone would when they love the other person with all their heart. There are not a lot of things in life that scare me but just the thought of losing you genuinely gives me nightmares. You are on my mind all the time and I wish I could be with you in person and be there with you on your birthday.   
                The only thing I want is to see you happy whether I am in your life or not. If anything were to happen to us I would definitely be upset but I would also be happy that I got to essentially grow up with you. The only thing I regret is the reason why I added you and the intense lust that followed. You are a beautiful person who deserves to be treated with the utmost respect and given only the purest of love and if I could go back and change how I was when we first started talking I would do it in a heartbeat. I want you to know Gabby that my love for you is not bound to time or space. When all the stars inevitably go dark and the galaxies drift apart, I'll be there holding your hand in the quiet as the universe fades away to start anew for me to find and fall for you all over again.

        <p>&copy; [12/26/2025] | This will be a year I will never forget. We both had our ups and downs but at the end we still have each other. Remember when you lied to me about your age? Still have no idea why you did that. You are definitely a character and I love you very much. Happy 18th birthday beautiful!</p>
